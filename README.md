# emotion-detection-using-neural-network
This project implements an emotion detection system using deep learning techniques, specifically a neural network model trained to classify human emotions based on facial expressions (or text/audio, if applicable). The goal is to accurately identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and neutrality.
